#### Web Page – COMP 4610 GUI Programming HW1
### Project Overview

This is my first web development project for COMP 4610 – GUI I. The assignment required creating a simple but non-trivial HTML5 webpage with proper documentation, external CSS styling, and hosting the page using GitHub Pages.

My chosen theme is Cars . The page describes the history of cars, types of vehicles, and compares electric vs gasoline cars. It also includes structured content such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, images, and links.

### Features Implemented

1. Proper HTML5 structure

2. Documentation at the top of all files

3. Headings (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>)

4. Paragraphs with more than 150 words of meaningful content

5. Table comparing Electric vs Gasoline cars

6. Images with alt text (placed inside /images/ folder)

7. Links to car-related resources (open in new tabs)

8. HTML entities (e.g., &copy;)

9. CSS in a separate file inside /css/style.css

10. Page validated with W3C HTML Validator
 and W3C CSS Validator


### Live Demo
