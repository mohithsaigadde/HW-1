  <h1>Welcome to the World of Cars</h1>
  <p>
    Cars have been one of the most influential inventions in modern history. 
    From the earliest models powered by steam to today’s advanced electric 
    vehicles, cars have shaped the way people travel, work, and live. 
    This page highlights the evolution of cars, explores their different 
    categories, and compares traditional gasoline-powered vehicles with 
    modern electric cars. Automobiles are more than just machines; they are 
    symbols of innovation, style, and freedom. &copy; 2025 Car Enthusiast Page.

  <!-- History Section -->
  <h2>A Brief History of Cars</h2>
  <p>
    The first practical automobiles were developed in the late 19th century. 
    Karl Benz is often credited with creating the first true car in 1886. 
    Since then, the industry has seen remarkable growth, with famous brands 
    like Ford introducing mass production and making cars affordable to 
    everyday people. Over time, cars evolved from simple transportation 
    tools into highly complex machines equipped with computers, sensors, 
    and cutting-edge designs.
